This Java code defines a custom item called `MetalDetectorItem` in a Minecraft mod. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Package Declaration**:
   ```java
   package net.ij.tutorialmod.item.custom;
   ```
   This code belongs to the package `net.ij.tutorialmod.item.custom`. Java packages are used for organizing classes into namespaces.

2. **Imports**:
   ```java
   import net.minecraft.block.Block;
   import net.minecraft.block.BlockState;
   import net.minecraft.block.Blocks;
   import net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerEntity;
   import net.minecraft.item.Item;
   import net.minecraft.item.ItemUsageContext;
   import net.minecraft.text.Text;
   import net.minecraft.util.ActionResult;
   import net.minecraft.util.math.BlockPos;
   ```
   These are import statements that bring in necessary classes and packages for the code to compile and function correctly. They import classes from the Minecraft game engine necessary for interacting with blocks, items, players, etc.

3. **Class Definition**:
   ```java
   public class MetalDetectorItem extends Item {
   ```
   This declares a class named `MetalDetectorItem` which extends the `Item` class. This means `MetalDetectorItem` is a type of item in the game.

4. **Constructor**:
   ```java
   public MetalDetectorItem(Settings settings) {
       super(settings);
   }
   ```
   This is the constructor for the `MetalDetectorItem` class. It calls the constructor of the superclass (`Item`) with the provided `settings`.

5. **Override `useOnBlock` Method**:
   ```java
   @Override
   public ActionResult useOnBlock(ItemUsageContext context) {
   ```
   This method overrides the `useOnBlock` method from the superclass (`Item`). It defines the behavior of the item when used on a block.

6. **Method Implementation**:
   ```java
   if(!context.getWorld().isClient()) {
   ```
   This condition checks if the game is not running on the client side (i.e., if it's the server or a single-player game).

   ```java
   BlockPos positionClicked = context.getBlockPos();
   PlayerEntity player = context.getPlayer();
   boolean foundBlock = false;
   ```
   These lines retrieve the position of the block clicked (`positionClicked`), the player who clicked (`player`), and initialize a boolean variable `foundBlock` to keep track of whether a valuable block was found.

   ```java
   for(int i = 0; i <= positionClicked.getY() + 64; i++) {
       BlockState state = context.getWorld().getBlockState(positionClicked.down(i));
   ```
   This loop iterates downwards from the clicked block position (up to 64 blocks down) and retrieves the `BlockState` of each block.

   ```java
   if(isValuableBlock(state)) {
       outputValuableCoordinates(positionClicked.down(i), player, state.getBlock());
       foundBlock = true;
       break;
   }
   ```
   It checks if the current block is a valuable block (defined by the `isValuableBlock` method). If so, it outputs the coordinates of the valuable block using `outputValuableCoordinates`, sets `foundBlock` to true, and breaks out of the loop.

   ```java
   if(!foundBlock) {
       player.sendMessage(Text.literal("No Valuables Found"));
   }
   ```
   If no valuable block was found, it sends a message to the player indicating that no valuables were found.

   ```java
   context.getStack().damage(1, context.getPlayer(), playerEntity -> playerEntity.sendToolBreakStatus(playerEntity.getActiveHand()));
   ```
   This line damages the item stack used by the player, simulating wear and tear. If the item breaks, it updates the player's inventory accordingly.

   ```java
   return ActionResult.SUCCESS;
   ```
   It returns `SUCCESS` to indicate that the action was successful.

7. **Helper Methods**:
   ```java
   private void outputValuableCoordinates(BlockPos blockPos, PlayerEntity player, Block block) {
       player.sendMessage(Text.literal("Found " + block.asItem().getName().getString() + " at " + 
               "(" + blockPos.getX() + "," + blockPos.getY() + "," + blockPos.getZ() + ")"), false);
   }
   ```
   This method constructs a message indicating that a valuable block was found and sends it to the player.

   ```java
   private boolean isValuableBlock(BlockState state) {
       return state.isOf(Blocks.IRON_ORE) || state.isOf(Blocks.DIAMOND_ORE);
   }
   ```
   This method checks if the provided `BlockState` represents a valuable block (either iron ore or diamond ore).

That's the detailed explanation of the provided Java code. It defines a custom item in a Minecraft mod that acts as a metal detector, allowing players to find valuable blocks like iron ore and diamond ore.
